from the cambridge dictionary https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/minor


When I was a baby, I would look at people around me, and adults would often remark that I had the look of an adult, the way my eyes conveyed seriousness. Unlike most babies, I never had a crawling phase, I learned to walk, and then I walked. Even before my brain started making long-term memories, I carried myself with dignity. This would become a theme in my early life.


Grievances I had (and still endorse) from being under 18 years of age:

## kindergarten:
- I was held against my will for half my waking hours at a facility with many other children
- Sometimes, I would grip the doorframe of the entrance to the campus, trying to signal to the adults around me that I did not want to be there. The kindergarten was a place of boredom and indignity. At home, I was most interested in using the computer, which I started doing at age four. 
- The "activities" at kindergarten did not help me kill time whatsoever. On offer:
  - Colored blocks and other basic toys. No books or computers.
  - Talking to other children, who never have anything interesting to say
  - Playing with fellow children (how many times a day do you think "God, I'm so bored, I wish I was playing colored blocks with a 5 year old"?)
  - (mandatory) time outside on campus grounds. My favored activity outside was staring at the chain-link fence and trying to make my eyes uncross enough for the chain-links to overlap and create an interesting 3D effect. I did this many times. 
  - (mandatory) 1-hour "nap time", during which I never slept. Talking or doing anything else other than staying very still in bed was prohibited.
- Every day, there would be a meal. One of the meals in the rotation was buckwheat submerged in milk. I found it revolting enough that the smell alone made me throw up once. This would be fine on its own, but eating was mandatory. If you refuse to eat your food, as I sometimes did, one of the "teachers" would take your spoon, scoop up some food, and then try to put it in your mouth. The idea of an adult I don't trust putting a spoon of bad-tasting food into my open mouth was so bad that I took the spoon and forced myself to eat the disgusting meal with my own hands. This was an affront to both my dignity and bodily autonomy
- Once I asked if I could wash my hands before the meal, because I knew that going somewhere without "teacher" permission is prohibited. The response I got was "You SHOULD wash your hands". Instead of hand-washing being a good thing I could do for myself, it's an obligation. My agency is denied, and instead of praise for doing a good thing, there's the implication that hand-washing is the default behavior, and if I don't do it, I will be punished
- I don't remember ever being taught anything in kindergarten. I learned to read and write, as well as basic arithmetic, outside of it.
- I spent most of my time in a strong state of dissociation. I know it was strong because I have no memories of it, but my mom tells me that almost always I would sit on a bench in the corner of the room and stare into space.

Overall, my experience in kindergarten was boring at best, and humiliating at worst. My dignity, bodily autonomy, comfort, and freedom in general, were disregarded daily as a matter of simple convenience, and because that is the norm. 


## intermediate
- In the middle of my last year of kindergarten, and before my first year of school, my family moved cities, and my parents decided that it wasn't worth the effort to enrol me into a new kindergarten for only 6 months. For 6 months, I could just stay home and choose what I do and when. I distinctly remember feeling surprised about how much my mood improved, and thinking "this is the best I've ever felt in my life"
- I did a few sessions of therapy for my brain architecture problems (somewhere in the OCD/Tourettes cluster, it's not clear to this day what's wrong with my brain, but it's not a big deal), which involved talking to a therapist about mundane topics and playing with sand. The contents of the therapy sessions is beside the point though, because the notable thing for me was how the therapist treated me. She was a professional in the private sector (aka the free market), and my parents were her clients, and by extension I was kind of her client. She treated me with *dignity*. This was absolutely mindblowing to me. When I said something to her, she listened, and then gave responses to MY words. I was feeling surprised because I was having a *conversation*. I could say something and that would *influence* the thing she would say, and *that* would influence what I would say, so the topic of conversation would depend on my words. MY WORDS. I remember saying something dull, and feeling embarrassed, because I was not used to having conversations where what I say is meaningful. She was unlike other adults in that respect, and I enjoyed our sessions greatly, even though they did not help with my brain issues, and provided me with no useful insights, other than the experience of having a real conversation.


## primary education
- I was held against my will for around third my waking hours at a facility with many other children, and forced to do additional unpaid and mostly pointless work for multiple hours at home. You wake up at 7:00, before dawn, and are free to go home around 15:00. In winter months, that leaves you with one hour of daylight every weekday.
